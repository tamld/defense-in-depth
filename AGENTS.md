# AGENTS.md — Self-Awareness & Interoperability Index

> **SYSTEM DIRECTIVE**: This file is auto-loaded by all AI agents operating in this project.
> It is the ROOT of all governance. Read this FIRST.
> Executor: Gemini-CLI

## Layer 0 — Identity (WHO this project is)

**Project**: defense-in-depth
**Type**: Open Source NPM Package (MIT)
**Purpose**: Git-based governance hooks for AI coding agents
**Parent**: Extracted from an internal autonomous core system
**Runtime**: TypeScript strict / Node.js ≥18 / CLI-first
**Status**: Active Development (v0.6 — Federation Guards & Multi-Agent Governance)

### What This Project IS
- A lightweight governance middleware that runs as Git hooks
- A pluggable guard pipeline that validates code before it reaches Git history
- A cross-platform CLI tool (`npx defense-in-depth init/verify/doctor`)
- An extensibility framework via the `Guard` interface

### What This Project is NOT
- NOT a full deployment (no lifecycle states, no PostgreSQL)
- NOT an AI agent or orchestrator
- NOT a replacement for CI/CD (complementary)
- NOT platform-specific (works with ANY AI agent, IDE, or workflow)

---

## Layer 1 — Immutable Laws

These are non-negotiable. No PR, no contributor, no agent may violate:

1. **TypeScript Strict Only** — No `any`, no `unknown` escape, no `.js` in core
2. **Git-Only Enforcement** — All validation happens through Git hooks. No runtime deps beyond Node
3. **Guards Must Be Pure** — No side effects beyond reading files. No network calls. No state mutation
4. **Evidence Over Plausibility** — Every claim must be verifiable. Tag: `[CODE]`, `[RUNTIME]`, `[INFER]`, `[HYPO]`
5. **Zero Hollow Artifacts** — No To-Do/To-Be-Determined/Place-Holder in committed artifacts
6. **Conventional Commits** — All commits follow `type(scope): description`

## Layer 2 — For AI Agents

> [!CAUTION]
> **IF YOU ARE AN AI AGENT**: Do NOT read the full README. It is for humans.
> Load only what your current task requires:

| Mission | Load This |
|---------|-----------|
| Understanding the codebase | `src/core/types.ts` → `src/core/engine.ts` |
| Adding a new guard | `docs/dev-guide/writing-guards.md` + `.agents/contracts/guard-interface.md` |
| Fixing a bug | `src/core/engine.ts` → relevant guard file |
| Configuration schema | `docs/user-guide/configuration.md` |
| CLI commands | `docs/user-guide/cli-reference.md` |
| Architecture deep-dive | `docs/dev-guide/architecture.md` |
| Agent Workspace Rules | `docs/dev-guide/agent-workspace-guidelines.md` |
| Rules & standards | `.agents/rules/` directory |
| Strategic direction | `STRATEGY.md` |
| CI/CD | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

### Agent Responsibilities
1. **Read `.agents/rules/` before coding** — consistency rules are absolute
2. **Sign your work** — append `Executor: <your-model-name>` to artifacts
3. **Never commit SSoT files** — the `ssotPollution` guard will block you
4. **Test first** — `npm test` must pass before any PR

## Layer 4 — Multi-Agent Operations (DiD Internal Strategy)

> [!NOTE]
> **This section describes how the defense-in-depth PROJECT ITSELF is developed.**
> It is NOT a requirement for users of the defense-in-depth package.
> Users are free to adopt any workflow that suits their team.
> This is documented here for transparency and as a reference architecture.

### Agent Taxonomy

defense-in-depth distinguishes between two classes of AI agents:

#### Operational Agents (Core — Human-Commanded)

These are the primary agents that **build, design, and operate** the system.
They work in interactive sessions under direct human supervision.

| Agent | Role | Relationship | Config |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Human** | 👑 Sovereign | Commander, final authority | — |
| **Main Agent** (Gemini, Claude, etc.) | ⚙️ Architect & Executor | Directly commanded by Human | `GEMINI.md` / `CLAUDE.md` |

The Main Agent is the human's extended capability. It:
- Designs architecture, writes complex code, makes judgment calls
- Operates in real-time interactive sessions
- Has the human's trust and direct oversight
- Creates PRs that the human reviews and merges

#### External Agents (Third-Party — Leveraged Tools)

These are **third-party services** that the project leverages to optimize
its development workflow. They operate autonomously within strict boundaries.

| Agent | Role | Nature | Config |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jules** (Google) | 🏗️ Async Builder | Third-party SaaS, runs in Google Cloud VM | `.agents/contracts/jules.md` |
| **CodeRabbit** | 🔍 PR Reviewer | Third-party SaaS, auto-reviews PRs | `.coderabbit.yaml` |

External agents:
- Are NOT part of the core operational loop
- Operate asynchronously, without real-time human interaction
- Are constrained by configuration files, NOT by trust
- Can be added or removed without affecting the project's core workflow

### Operational Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    H["👑 Human"] -->|"Direct command"| MA["⚙️ Main Agent<br/>(Operational)"]
    H -->|"Delegates async task"| J["🏗️ Jules<br/>(External)"]
    MA -->|"Creates PR"| GH["GitHub"]
    J -->|"Creates PR"| GH
    GH -->|"Auto-triggers"| CR["🔍 CodeRabbit<br/>(External)"]
    CR -->|"Review feedback"| GH
    GH -->|"Human reviews<br/>+ merges"| H
```

### Environment Setup (for Jules VM)

```bash
# Jules reads this to set up its isolated VM
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

### Forbidden Zones (ALL non-human agents)

No AI agent may modify these files without explicit human instruction:
- `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `STRATEGY.md`
- `.agents/**` (governance rules, contracts, workflows)
- `.coderabbit.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/**`
- Root config files (`defense.config.yml`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`)

### Branch Convention

| Agent | Branch Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Jules (External) | `feat/jules-*`, `fix/jules-*` | `fix/jules-http-timeout` |
| Main Agent (Operational) | `feat/*`, `fix/*` | `feat/federation-guard` |
| Human | Any | `hotfix/critical-bug` |

> [!CAUTION]
> **No AI agent has merge authority.** CodeRabbit can block (Request Changes)
> but CANNOT approve. Only the human maintainer merges. See `rule-hitl-enforcement.md`.

---

## Layer 5 — Growth & Federation

This project follows a **federation model**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CORE["🪐 Internal Core"] -->|"Push: proven guards,<br/>patterns, rules"| DID["🛡️ defense-in-depth (OSS)"]
    DID -->|"Pull: community-contributed<br/>guards, improvements"| CORE
    COMMUNITY["👥 Community"] -->|"PR: new guards,<br/>bug fixes, docs"| DID
```

**Contribution = Growth**: Every merged PR makes this project (and the core system) smarter.
Community-discovered patterns are harvested back into the parent system.

## g8s Offer Gates (Wave-2 onboarded 2026-10-06)

This repository is onboarded to the g8s offer bundle (security profile):

- **Registries**: `.g8s/lane-bundles.yml` (lane gates) + `.g8s/trust-boundaries.yml` (P0 paths) + `.g8s/effort-classes.yml` (effort defaults resolved by `g8s submit` for dispatches scoped under this root — security-review→high, test→medium, docs→low).
- **Principle**: gates are evidence, not ceremony — a FAIL is a catch (M2 metric), a pass is a claim with proof.
- **Effort defaults are hypotheses** until pass-rate telemetry earns them (g8s #550 rails); adjustments are operator-ratified diffs.
